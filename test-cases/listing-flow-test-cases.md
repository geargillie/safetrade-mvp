## ðŸš€ TEST EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Priority Levels:

**P1 - Critical**: Core functionality that breaks the marketplace if failing
- Authentication & Authorization
- Listing Creation/Update/Delete
- Database Operations
- Security Tests

**P2 - Important**: Features that significantly impact user experience
- Form Validation
- Image Upload
- VIN Verification
- Step Navigation

**P3 - Nice to Have**: Enhancement features and edge cases
- Auto-save
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced validation scenarios

### Automation Recommendations:

**Automated Tests**:
- API endpoint tests
- Database operation tests
- Form validation tests
- Security/injection tests

**Manual Tests**:
- UI/UX flow tests
- Browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Complex user scenarios

### Test Data Management:

**Test Users**:
- Standard user account
- Admin/privileged account
- Test user with existing listings
- Test user without listings

**Test Listings**:
- Complete listing with all fields
- Minimal listing with required fields only
- Listing with maximum images
- Listing with verified VIN

### Continuous Testing:

- Run automated tests on every deployment
- Manual regression testing for major releases
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing with penetration tools

## ðŸ“Š TEST REPORTING

Each test case should be documented with:
- **Test ID**: Unique identifier
- **Priority**: P1/P2/P3
- **Status**: Pass/Fail/Blocked
- **Last Executed**: Date of last test run
- **Notes**: Any observations or issues
- **Screenshots**: For visual confirmation where needed

**Success Criteria**: All P1 tests must pass before production deployment. P2 tests should have >95% pass rate. P3 tests tracked but not deployment blocking.

This comprehensive test suite ensures the SafeTrade marketplace listing flow is robust, secure, and provides an excellent user experience across all scenarios.
